# Pokemon-analysis

Hi guys! In this notebook I did some analyses with a dataset of pokemons from 6 different generations. I explored some insights with statistics and also provided some interactive plots.

First, as usual, I described the variables of the dataset and did some treatment with strings and null values.

Then, I calculated the classical statistical values, such as mean, median and standart deviation (std), just to give a statistical summary.

Finally, I started the visualizations. In this section, I could explore histograms, violin plot, boxplot, swarmplot and a matrix for correlation analysis.

I also built two interactive visualizations: a treemap to visualize the percentage of types in each generation and a sccater plot with the variables "Attack" and "Defense" comparing two types, so you can get prepared for a battle against a pokemon with a type different than yours :)
